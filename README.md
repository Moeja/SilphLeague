# Digital resources for the promotion of The Silph League

A collection of promotional material for the Silph League communities around the globe. This first version includes badge files for the community events in vector and 3D format, ready for ** laser cutting and 3d printing**.

3D models have been optimized in dimensions and resolution for 0.4 nozzles. Feel free to modify the OpenSCAD or STL files to your liking.
